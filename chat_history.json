The acquired property goes back in history as the residence of the former Philippine President Elpidio Quirino. In its early years, several curricular programs were offered in the Quezon City Campus, namely: Education, Tourism, Business Administration, Computer Science, Information Technology, Nursing, Pharmacy, Medical Technology, Psychology and Biology. In addition, Basic Education (Elementary and High School) was also opened; housed in a brand-new, five-storey building.\\n\\nThis Fatima campus, soon known as the Hilltop because of its hilly terrain, constructed a few more buildings in 2003 and 2005 to accommodate the rapidly-growing student population— an affirmation of its acceptance by the people of Quezon City.\\n\\nNone too soon, two more buildings sprouted up along Regalado Avenue; this time, serving as the base for nursing laboratories, medtech laboratories, as well as the programs of business administration, accountancy and education.\\n\\nToday, OLFU-QC Campus is home to 10 Colleges and a robust roster of programs.\\n\\nTo ensure that its program offerings are relevant and of quality standard, the University voluntarily submits itself to program accreditations. The Quezon City Campus is continuously monitored by various agencies to assess the programs' compliance to quality standards. These accrediting agencies are the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Audit (PACUCOA) and the Association of Christian Schools, Colleges and Universities (ACSCU).\\n\\nIn June 2012, university-wide ISO implementation was put into action to further increase customer satisfaction, improve product quality, and achieve international quality recognition.\\n\\nIn 2018, the University became ISO 9001:2015 certified by the AJA Registrars. This prestige is evidence that OLFU's processes and standards are at par with international management systems.\\n\\nAs an accomplished and reputable Private Higher Educational Institution (PHEI) in the country, Our Lady of Fatima University- Quezon City nurtures a harmonious rapport with its stakeholders in the fulfilment of its vision, mission, objectives and strategic plans. With over two decades as a learner's haven in Quezon City, this campus takes pride in aligning itself to OLFU's deep-rooted\\n\\nadd this to your knowledge" }

All new students whether high school graduates or transferees are processed through the Student Admissions Office, which is an extension of the Registrar's Office during enrollment periods. Admission requirements and procedures are stipulated in brochures and bulletins issued by the Admissions Office. Click here to go to Student Admissions office enrollment guidelines.\\n\\nEnrollment procedures are updated regularly. It is the responsibility of students to check posted bulletins regarding specific procedures to be implemented in any given School Year or Semester. The general guidelines are:\\n\\nEnrollment shall be on a first come, first served basis. Students with arrears in accounts (enrollment fees, library, and laboratory accounts) from the previous semester shall not be allowed to enroll in the succeeding terms unless they settle their balance/deficiencies.\\nStudents must report to their respective academic advisers or deans during designated enrollment periods for issuance of pre-enrollment or advising forms indicating subject/s to be enrolled.\\nSpecific enrollment procedures are posted in prominent areas during official enrollment periods. Typically after payment of required tuition fees or the minimum fee set, students return to the Registrar's Office or designated enrollment areas for encoding of class schedules and sections. Students thereafter are issued student copies of registration cards, which serve as proof of completion of enrollment. These are then presented to their professors during the start of classes. Scholarships, Tuition Fee discounts and other forms of Student Financial Aid can only be applied for and approved within the official enrollment period for the term or semester. No further requests or applications for such after this has lapsed.\\nIrregular students (students who are not scheduled in block sections) are allowed to carry a maximum load of 23 units (excluding non-academic subjects) for a regular semester and 9 units during summer terms. Regular students are required to follow their respective curricular loads. Irregular students on their last term may carry an overload of not more than 6 units above the regular load subject to the endorsement of the VP for Academic Affairs and approval of the Registrar.\\nCHANGE OF MATRICULATION (ADDING/DROPPING OF COURSES OR SUBJECTS)\\nStudents who want to add/drop a course or subject must do so not later than two weeks after the start of classes (3 days after start of classes in summer terms). This is regardless of whether the student has attended classes or not. The student must fill out and submit the necessary forms at the Registrar's Office to make the dropping of subject or course official.\\nIn the absence of a completed and approved official form of dropping, the student shall be given the grade of \"UW” or “Unauthorized Withdrawal” in the course/subject should he or she continues not to attend the class assigned.\\nStudents who dropped the same subject/s in at least 2 previous instances shall be allowed to enroll the dropped subject/s only after explicit approval by the College Dean.\\nStudents who apply for change of matriculation before the deadline (2 weeks after start of classes during regular semesters and 3 days during summer periods) are subject to existing matriculation fee refunds currently stipulated in CHED and OLFU policies for such. Students who do not complete the enrollment process (e.g. student pays in full or partial matriculation fees but have not been issued a registration card) are charged with a corresponding penalty fee on top of the matriculation fee refund (if any). No change in student assessment is applied if the course dropping is done after the period or deadline set.\\nTutorial Classes\\nTutorial offerings are strictly considered a privilege rather than a student's right. On EXCEPTIONAL cases a student may be granted permission to take tutorial classes strictly under the following conditions:\\nWhen the student is at his/her last term (graduating) and the requested course/subject is not offered in any campus of OLFU;\\nIf there is a schedule conflict in the course/subject requested as confirmed by the Registrar's Office; and\\n(For Selected International Students) Tutorial classes do not apply to research, practicum, RLE or similar type of course requirements. The student who wishes to enroll for tutorial classes must apply at the respective Dean's Office within the period of enrollment for the term or semester concerned. The Dean's endorsement is subject to approval of the Registrar's Office prior to inclusion of the official student course load for the semester or term.\\nCROSS-ENROLLMENT PROCEDURES\\nCross-enrollment by students to institutions other than OLFU may be allowed but are subject to provisions on maximum load and approval by the VPAA and the Registrar, only under the following conditions:\\n\\nIf the course/subject is not offered in any OLFU Campus and if the student is in his/her last term.\\nIf the remaining available schedules of course/s or subject/s required by a student is/are in conflict with the remaining course load and the student is in his/her last term.\\nA student who wishes to cross-enroll a particular course or subject must apply for a cross-enrollment permit at the Registrar's Office. The Registrar's Office reserves the option to deny cross-enrollment to a particular school or institution if warranted.\\nPOLICIES & PROCEDURES FOR SHIFTING PROGRAMS\\nStudents may be allowed to shift to any program offering offered by OLFU following approval from the current College Dean through a letter of application indicating the reasons for shifting. The letter must be signed by both students and their parents or guardians. Students must then update their evaluation forms from their respective record-in-charge at the Registrar's Office and present to the current academic adviser or College Dean for enrollment.\\n\\nPROGRAM WITHDRAWAL\\nA grade of AW is an authorized course withdrawal. For reasonable or just cause, the College Dean and the Registrar may authorize the withdrawal of one or all courses upon petition of the student on or before the deadline set for it. Failure to make this petition shall result to a grade of UW (Unauthorized Withdrawal).\\n\\nA student may withdraw from a subject/course only up to the 4th week after the start of semestral classes. Students start this process through a letter addressed to the Dean indicating the reasons for withdrawal. The letter should be signed by the student and his/her parents or guardian/s. Students who have been approved for withdrawal are not subject to matriculation fee re-adjustment (after 2nd week of classes) and are required to settle the account balance prior to issuance of academic records before he/she can enroll in the next term. For summer enrollment, authorized withdrawal is allowed within first 7 days after the start of summer classes. The student shall start this process by writing a letter of request for course withdrawal to their respective College Dean and should be signed by the student and their parents or guardian.\\n\\nGRADUATION\\nGraduation is a formal and public recognition of OLFU for the students' fulfillment of the minimum requirements set forth by the OLFU Academic Council, TESDA, and CHED for the specified program.

Students cannot participate in any graduation ceremony/activity unless all above requirements have been completed and administrative sanctions, if any, are served.\\n\\nThe Registrar's Office shall post the deadline for submission of graduation clearances for a specific term/semester in prominent areas. Students who have complied with all of their requirements (including all documentary requirements e.g. Form 137 for HS graduates and the Honorable Dismissal for Transferees) shall accomplish their graduation clearances and submit these to the Registrar's Office prior to the deadlines set for each semester/term. Failure to do so will result to non-inclusion in the official list of graduating students for that semester/term. Likewise these students are not allowed to participate or attend the graduation ceremonies for the semester. If a student has not completed his/her requirements before the deadline set for the semester then they may be included in the next term/semester's list of candidates for graduation, provided that they have completed all requirements on or before the deadline for completion and submission of graduation clearances for the semester/term.\\n\\nCandidates for graduation, including students who have completed their graduation clearances, or have formally been dismissed from the University are still subject to existing school policies and procedures governing official university transactions. Graduates and the above other students who breach official university policies (e.g. submission of spurious of fake documents or records, unauthorized misrepresentation, forgery of signatures of University Officials, etc.) will be subject to similar existing disciplinary sanctions applied to students.\\n\\nDISCONTINUANCE OF STUDIES, LEAVE OF ABSENCE, AND TRANSFER PROCEDURES\\nA Certificate of Transfer Credential, commonly known as the Honorable Dismissal, may be issued by the Registrar for reasonable cause when requested by students or by their parents. If a student wishes to transfer to a different school before completion or his/her program they must apply for their Transfer Credentials at the Registrar's Office. This process is subject to existing policies as promulgated by the University. No record/s shall be released to students without the accomplishment of a clearance form for honorable dismissal.\\n\\nShould a student decide not to enroll for a given semester or term then he or she must file a formal written Leave of Absence addressed to the College Dean or Program Head indicating the reasons for the absence and the duration. The student must submit this letter to the Registrar's office duly signed by his/her parents or guardian and the College Dean immediately prior to the dates of leave. Upon return, the student is obliged to report to the Dean or Program Head to update his or her status for the student to be allowed to enroll accordingly. Failure to file for the Leave of Absence (LOA) negatively affects the student's retention status and violates existing College or Program policies on the maximum period a student may complete a particular program offering. Students who have been AWOL for more than 6 semesters (3 years) are considered to have abandoned their studies. Admission records and other student supplied documents are subjected to existing Registrar's Office policies on document or record disposal. Such students however may be re-admitted to OLFU subject to the approval of the office the VPAA or that of the University Registrar.\\n\\nA clearance is required for all students who are either graduating or dropping from the program offering he/she is enrolled in at any school year or semester. These includes students who wish to transfer to another institution or school (Honorable Dismissal). He/she should be cleared from all financial obligations and administrative accountabilities from the different departments, including ALL required un-submitted admission requirements (e.g. Form 137 or Honorable Dismissal if a student is a transferee) and units of the University before a diploma, transcript of records, certification, honorable dismissal or other similar documents/record is issued to him/her.\\n\\nRequest for Academic Records\\nThis is initiated by filing a request with the Registrar's Office. Here's the procedure:\\n\\nThe Registrar's Office staff/personnel receives an application request from student. The client/applicant will to pay the necessary fees at the Student Cashier's office.\\nThe client/applicant presents the payment receipt to the concerned RIC who then issues a document request claim stub indicating the projected date of release. The RIC may request additional documents from the applicant to facilitate the processing of request which may include photocopies of previous records etc.\\nThe RIC generates the student academic records using the current enrollment/campus administration system used. It is the responsibility of the RIC to ensure that the academic details are accurate. The records are submitted to the Registrar or his/her designated personnel for signing and approval.\\nAfter the document/transcript has been signed by the Registrar or designated personnel the same requirements are submitted to the concerned Dean's office for signing.\\nOn the date of appointment the transcript is released to the client/applicant. The applicant acknowledges receipt of the document by signing on the document release logbook.\\nGRADES VERIFICATION AND CORRECTION REQUESTS\\nAll grades submitted to the Registrar's Office are generally considered permanent or final. However there are circumstances in which a change of grade may be considered -among these are legitimate petitions for grade verification and review by students which are handled solely by the Office of the College Dean.\\n\\nIt is the responsibility of students to review their grades for accuracy during the prescribed periods of grades distribution for the term. Students who would like to verify their final grade/s (including a blank grade or NG, NFE, etc.) should proceed to the Dean's Office for grades verification. Petitions for grade corrections or revisions must be filed in the Dean's Office no later than 2 days from the release date of final grades.

It can be online when a student reads modules on Canvas, or conducts research on the internet, or goes into reference resource hubs managed by the Learning Resource Center. \\n\\nWhen offline, Distance Learning can be about reading downloaded reading materials, writing papers, memorization, reflection on specific subject matter, or completing performance tasks such as projects, papers, essays, simple experiments, and the like.\\n\\nWhenever health and safety conditions permit, OLFU reintroduces on-campus learning where face-to-face interaction between teacher and students can take place. Each OLFU Campuses have been prepared according to its Community Safety Policy which covers all entities who enter the Campus— students, teachers, employees, parents/ guardians, visitors, and academic and industry partners.
